# Faker Functions npm breakdown

## About this repo...

This repo has been pulled together to be a place to assemble fake data to use for testing of backend projects. This repo uses the npm package ```@faker-js/faker``` 

The faker functions have been broken down into their respective js files in the ```fakerZone``` to generate data for backend testing at scale. 

If you get lost at any point, please refer to the official documentation here [@faker-js/faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faker-js/faker)

## Step 1 
Install dependencies 
``` 
npm i

faker & fs are the main things you need for this repo to work 

```

## Step 2
Glance over the ```fakerZone dir``` to check out some of the functionality available from faker and a get a grasp for the syntax of the functions 


## Step 3 
Head to ```functionGenerator.js``` inside the ```main directory``` and build your own ```createRandomUser().``` Some examples have already been provided ðŸš€

## Step 4 
Once you have selected your fakeFunctions and the number of randomUsers you want to generate, ```run node functionGenerator.js.``` Once this has been run, ```go to file.json``` where all of your fake data will be held. This will not be formatted so remember to format the document to get a more appealing visual on the data ðŸ‘€

## Step 5 
Enjoy! ðŸ™‚
